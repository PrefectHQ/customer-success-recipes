# Prefect Recipes üßë‚Äçüç≥ ü•ê

This repository contains common and extensible Prefect patterns to drive efficient workflows &mdash; we like to call these patterns [our **recipes**](#table-of-contents-)!

Here you'll find starter code and more advanced example use cases.

## Contributing = Swag üß¢
We're always looking for new contributions! Check out [Contributions](#contributions) to learn how you can add your Prefect 2.0 recipe and earn some swag!
